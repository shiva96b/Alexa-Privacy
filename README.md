## Analyzing Privacy Vulnerabilities of 3rd Party Skills in Alexa

Privacy Project for CSC 533

Smart speakers have been popularly used around the world, mainly due to the convenience brought from the virtual personal assistant (VPA) which offers interactive actions through the convenient voice commands from users. Besides the built-in capabilities, VPA services can be further extended by third-party developers through skills. These skills attract users together with malicious developers. We plan to implement a skill explorer to systematically explore the interaction behaviors of skills developed for Alexa and identify the ones which violate the usersâ€™ privacy. The skill explorer will analyze the Alexa skills listed on the Amazon marketplace.
